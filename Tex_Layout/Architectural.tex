%Quality Requirements to be added - Keagan & Maret
\subsubsection{Scalability}
The software system must be able to handle the registration and data of all the users registered on the LDAP server. 
If several users attempt to do the same action simultaneously, like commenting in a thread, the actions must appear to happen one at a time. 
The system must not have a maximum or minimum amount of users that may use the system at a time
\subsubsection{Performance requirement}

\subsubsection{Maintainability} 
The system must be easy to update and maintain.
\subsubsection{Reliability and Availability} 
The system must be usable on any (modern) web browser and operating system.
\subsubsection{Security}

\subsubsection{Monitorability and Auditability}

\subsubsection{Testability}

\subsubsection{Usability}
The Buzz sytem must be easy to use. It can make use of UI metaphors like a having a "post-it" symbol for the post operation or an envelope for the messages link.
The most common used operations must perform very quickly. The system must be easy to learn so new users can adapt to it without help. 
The validation and error messages must be clear and understandable.
\subsubsection{Integrability} 
The system mut be integrated with the LDAP server. 
All the data on the server like names, photos registered modules, etc are used in the buzz system.
